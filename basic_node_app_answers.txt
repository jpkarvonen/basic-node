1. What is a Node module?

Like a library, it is a collection of code that can be
imported and exported to be used anywhere in an application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

`exports` references the `module.exports` object

3. Why is using exports recommended?

When you use `exports` it cannot reassign `module.exports`, thus
you can avoid basic errors when sticking with  `exports`.
